# IOT-Based-Smart-Car-Parking-System
Raspberry Pi is a miniature computer which has the adaptability with sensors. The automated car parking system uses the Raspberry Pi. This work proposes an automated car parking system that uses infrared sensors. The infrared sensor senses the movement of the vehicle and transmits the signal to the Pi.


LED display is installed at the main entrance of the parking area to provide enough information about slot availability. In a real-time scenario, the proposed work can be enhanced further for multiple levels containing n number of slots with multiple Raspberry Pi.
